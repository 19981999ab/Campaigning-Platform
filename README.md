# Campaigning-Platform

# What are you planning to build?
The size and revenue of a political party affects the elections in our country to a huge extent. Bigger the party, bigger is the spending on campaigning by them. We plan to build a platform which provides every party equal resources by making them campaign online. This will save the huge amount of money that is currently wasted, trying to lure the voters. This will also force the parties to focus on delivering on their promises rather than trying to appease a community by taking decision in their favor since online campaigning on the portal will be highly regulated to weed to communal agendas of the parties.
The campaigning session will start on a specific date with the release of all the party videos and manifesto at the same. Each party will campaign using videos. The portal will be region specific, parties can customize their agendas according to the regions to connect with the voters better. Each candidates work will be listed so as to help the voter make a informed decision.
Also a report would be displayed which will serve as a quick overview of all the party agendas. For places with no internet, local newspapers would publish this report in a separate column. 
Personal campaigning by any candidate will be stopped, thus creating fairness in democracy. 
In addition, the portal would facilitate the voters to vote online on a scheduled date and time. This will help increase the vote count, since many people are not able to vote due to them not being away from their registered constituency.

# How does it work?
People can choose whether to vote online or offline. Those who (people who don't have Mobile/Laptops or do not have access to Internet) select offline mode will have to visit the poll booths where mobile phones would be kept. The person would select the candidate and the corresponding vote would be sent to a central database. All this would be implemented using Azure.
 A portal displaying campaigning videos and reports of a candidateâ€™s work would be displayed on another website also using Azure. 

# How users can get started with the project?
To access the website user have to create an account using a unique authentication id. Using this account, the user will be able to access all the campaigning videos and to choose a candidate of his own on the election day.

# What datasets are you using?
The dataset of all the eligible voters will be required, as they will be the only ones with the access to the website. Each person on the voters list will receive a unique authentication id similar to a voter id to access the website.
